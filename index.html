        This is a safe place for anyone to get whatever is bothering them off their chest. In the box on the screen, input a secret of yours. You will get someone else's secret back in return. So leave your secret with us, and take someone else's secret with you. <br><br> Remember, <b>Not All Secrets Are Meant To Be Kept</b>
